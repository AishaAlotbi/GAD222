Narrator "The woods of Nemo do not often welcome visitors. Yet it seems even the air here pities your frail form. A rare opportunity for one such as yourself, you'd do well not to squander it."

Item "Microscope Clicked A reliable apparatus, its sight far precedes yours. Perhaps the cure is in the little things, microscopic clues missed by your own eyes."

Item "Journal Clicked A trusted keeper of knowledge both old and new. Empty for now, but not for long."

Item "Beakers Clicked Surprisingly sturdy companions of the past decade. In spite of your academic pursuits, you quite dislike the idea of change."

Item "Scalpel Clicked Blood as a sacrifice to your means is no new ground, but beware, the woods, they listen… they watch…"

Item "Satchel Clicked A collection of odd plants sit in the small leather satchel. The woods of Nemo have always had mysterious vegetation."

Event "Night falls"

Narrator "The silence of the night engulfs you like crashing waves. A stark difference from the streets you called home, where sound mimicked a flowing waterfall."

Narrator "You’re torn on whether you should feel comforted or unnerved. It's as if something waits there, lingering in the quiet. Your eyes are heavy, your diseased body aches, you fall asleep still cautious."

Event "Inside, Morning"

Narrator "The convenience the city provides to those of your profession is something you greatly miss at this moment. Your research will not progress with an empty stock of herbs. Whilst your body detests the idea, you're required to venture forth and collect your own."

Event "Woods, Morning"

Narrator "The vegetation present in the woods is something that your mind struggles to comprehend. You begin to collect your odd findings, careful of them making contact with your own bare skin."

Narrator "Your satchel is full, but has space to hold more. Do you intend on collecting more before heading back?"
